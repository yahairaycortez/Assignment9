Two households, both alike in dignity, r n In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, r n From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, r n Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. r n From forth the fatal loins of these two foes r n A pair of star-cross &#39;d lovers take their life; r n Whose misadventur &#39;d piteous overthrows r n Doth with their death bury their parents &#39; strife. r n The fearful passage of their death-mark &#39;d love, r n And the continuance of their parents &#39; rage, r n Which, but their children &#39;s end, naught could remove, r n Is now the two hours &#39; traffic of our stage; r n The which if you with patient ears attend, r n What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. r n [Exit.] r n r n r n r n r nACT I. Scene I. r nVerona. A public place. r n r nEnter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house r nof Capulet. r n r n r n Samp. Gregory, on my word, we &#39;ll not carry coals. r n r n Greg. No, for then we should be colliers. r n r n Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we &#39;ll draw. r n r n Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar. r n r n Samp. I strike quickly, being moved. r n r n Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike. r n r n Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. r n r n Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand. r n Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn &#39;st away. r n r n Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take r n the wall of any man or maid of Montague &#39;s. r n r n Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the r n wall. r n r n Samp. &#39;Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, r n are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague &#39;s men r n from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall. r n r n Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. r n r n Samp. &#39;Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have r n fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off r n their heads. r n r n Greg. The heads of the maids? r n r n Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads. r n Take it in what sense thou wilt. r n r n Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it. r n r n Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and &#39;tis known I r n am a pretty piece of flesh. r n r n Greg. &#39;Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst r n been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of r n Montagues. r n r n Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar]. r n r n r n Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee. r n r n Greg. How? turn thy back and run? r n r n Samp. Fear me not. r n r n Greg. No, marry. I fear thee! r n r n Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. r n r n Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. r n r n Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is r n disgrace to them, if they bear it. r n r n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? r n r n Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir. r n r n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? r n r n Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay? r n r n Greg. [aside to Sampson] No. r n r n Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my r n thumb, sir. r n r n Greg. Do you quarrel, sir? r n r n Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir. r n r n Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as r n you. r n r n Abr. No better. r n r n Samp. Well, sir. r n r n Enter Benvolio. r n r n r n Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say &#39;better. &#39; Here comes one of my r n master &#39;s kinsmen. r n r n Samp. Yes, better, sir. r n r n Abr. You lie. r n r n Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. r n They fight. r n r n Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.] r n Put up your swords. You know not what you do. r n r n Enter Tybalt. r n r n r n Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? r n Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death. r n r n Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword, r n Or manage it to part these men with me. r n r n Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word r n As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee. r n Have at thee, coward! They fight. r n r n Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or r n partisans. r n r n r n Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down! r n r n Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues! r n r n Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife. r n r n r n Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! r n r n Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword? r n r n Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come r n And flourishes his blade in spite of me. r n r n Enter Old Montague and his Wife. r n r n r n Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go. r n r n M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe. r n r n Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train. r n r n r n Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, r n Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel- r n Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, r n That quench the fire of your pernicious rage r n With purple fountains issuing from your veins! r n On pain of torture, from those bloody hands r n Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground r n And hear the sentence of your moved prince. r n Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word r n By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, r n Have thrice disturb &#39;d the quiet of our streets r n And made Verona &#39;s ancient citizens r n Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments r n To wield old partisans, in hands as old, r n Cank &#39;red with peace, to part your cank &#39;red hate. r n If ever you disturb our streets again, r n Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. r n For this time all the rest depart away. r n You, Capulet, shall go along with me; r n And, Montague, come you this afternoon, r n To know our farther pleasure in this case, r n To old Freetown, our common judgment place. r n Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. r n Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio]. r n r n Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? r n Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? r n r n Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary r n And yours, close fighting ere I did approach. r n I drew to part them. In the instant came r n The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar &#39;d; r n Which, as he breath &#39;d defiance to my ears, r n He swung about his head and cut the winds, r n Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss &#39;d him in scorn. r n While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, r n Came more and more, and fought on part and part, r n Till the Prince came, who parted either part. r n r n M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day? r n Right glad I am he was not at this fray. r n r n Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp &#39;d sun r n Peer &#39;d forth the golden window of the East, r n A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; r n Where, underneath the grove of sycamore r n That westward rooteth from the city &#39;s side, r n So early walking did I see your son. r n Towards him I made; but he was ware of me r n And stole into the covert of the wood. r n I- measuring his affections by my own, r n Which then most sought where most might not be found, r n Being one too many by my weary self- r n Pursu &#39;d my humour, not Pursuing his, r n And gladly shunn &#39;d who gladly fled from me. r n r n Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen, r n With tears augmenting the fresh morning &#39;s dew, r n Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; r n But all so soon as the all-cheering sun r n Should in the furthest East bean to draw r n The shady curtains from Aurora &#39;s bed, r n Away from light steals home my heavy son r n And private in his chamber pens himself, r n Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight r n And makes himself an artificial night. r n Black and portentous must this humour prove r n Unless good counsel may the cause remove. r n r n Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? r n r n Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him r n r n Ben. Have you importun &#39;d him by any means? r n r n Mon. Both by myself and many other friend; r n But he, his own affections &#39; counsellor, r n Is to himself- I will not say how true- r n But to himself so secret and so close, r n So far from sounding and discovery, r n As is the bud bit with an envious worm r n Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air r n Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. r n Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, r n We would as willingly give cure as know. r n r n Enter Romeo. r n r n r n Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside, r n I &#39;ll know his grievance, or be much denied. r n r n Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay r n To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let &#39;s away, r n Exeunt [Montague and Wife]. r n r n Ben. Good morrow, cousin. r n r n Rom. Is the day so young? r n r n Ben. But new struck nine. r n r n Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long. r n Was that my father that went hence so fast? r n r n Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo &#39;s hours? r n r n Rom. Not having that which having makes them short. r n r n Ben. In love? r n r n Rom. Out- r n r n Ben. Of love? r n r n Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love. r n r n Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view, r n Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! r n r n Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still, r n Should without eyes see pathways to his will! r n Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? r n Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. r n Here &#39;s much to do with hate, but more with love. r n Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate! r n O anything, of nothing first create! r n O heavy lightness! serious vanity! r n Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! r n Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! r n Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is r n This love feel I, that feel no love in this. r n Dost thou not laugh? r n r n Ben. No, coz, I rather weep. r n r n Rom. Good heart, at what? r n r n Ben. At thy good heart &#39;s oppression. r n r n Rom. Why, such is love &#39;s transgression. r n Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, r n Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest r n With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown r n Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. r n Love is a smoke rais &#39;d with the fume of sighs; r n Being purg &#39;d, a fire sparkling in lovers &#39; eyes; r n Being vex &#39;d, a sea nourish &#39;d with lovers &#39; tears. r n What is it else? A madness most discreet, r n A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. r n Farewell, my coz. r n r n Ben. Soft! I will go along. r n An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. r n r n Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here: r n This is not Romeo, he &#39;s some other where. r n r n Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love? r n r n Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee? r n r n Ben. Groan? Why, no; r n But sadly tell me who. r n r n Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will. r n Ah, word ill urg &#39;d to one that is so ill! r n In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. r n r n Ben. I aim &#39;d so near when I suppos &#39;d you lov &#39;d. r n r n Rom. A right good markman! And she &#39;s fair I love. r n r n Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. r n r n Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She &#39;ll not be hit r n With Cupid &#39;s arrow. She hath Dian &#39;s wit, r n And, in strong proof of chastity well arm &#39;d, r n From Love &#39;s weak childish bow she lives unharm &#39;d. r n She will not stay the siege of loving terms, r n Nor bide th &#39; encounter of assailing eyes, r n Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. r n O, she &#39;s rich in beauty; only poor r n That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store. r n r n Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? r n r n Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; r n For beauty, starv &#39;d with her severity, r n Cuts beauty off from all posterity. r n She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, r n To merit bliss by making me despair. r n She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow r n Do I live dead that live to tell it now. r n r n Ben. Be rul &#39;d by me: forget to think of her. r n r n Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think! r n r n Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes. r n Examine other beauties. r n r n Rom. &#39;Tis the way r n To call hers (exquisite) in question more. r n These happy masks that kiss fair ladies &#39; brows, r n Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair. r n He that is strucken blind cannot forget r n The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. r n Show me a mistress that is passing fair, r n What doth her beauty serve but as a note r n Where I may read who pass &#39;d that passing fair? r n Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget. r n r n Ben. I &#39;ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt. r n r n r n r n r nScene II. r nA Street. r n r nEnter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown. r n r n r n Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I, r n In penalty alike; and &#39;tis not hard, I think, r n For men so old as we to keep the peace. r n r n Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both, r n And pity &#39;tis you liv &#39;d at odds so long. r n But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? r n r n Cap. But saying o &#39;er what I have said before: r n My child is yet a stranger in the world, r n She hath not seen the change of fourteen years; r n Let two more summers wither in their pride r n Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. r n r n Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made. r n r n Cap. And too soon marr &#39;d are those so early made. r n The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; r n She is the hopeful lady of my earth. r n But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart; r n My will to her consent is but a part. r n An she agree, within her scope of choice r n Lies my consent and fair according voice. r n This night I hold an old accustom &#39;d feast, r n Whereto I have invited many a guest, r n Such as I love; and you among the store, r n One more, most welcome, makes my number more. r n At my poor house look to behold this night r n Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light. r n Such comfort as do lusty young men feel r n When well apparell &#39;d April on the heel r n Of limping Winter treads, even such delight r n Among fresh female buds shall you this night r n Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see, r n And like her most whose merit most shall be; r n Which, on more view of many, mine, being one, r n May stand in number, though in reck &#39;ning none. r n Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go, r n sirrah, trudge about r n Through fair Verona; find those persons out r n Whose names are written there, and to them say, r n My house and welcome on their pleasure stay- r n Exeunt [Capulet and Paris]. r n r n Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written r n that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor r n with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter r n with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are r n here writ, and can never find what names the writing person r n hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time! r n r n Enter Benvolio and Romeo. r n r n r n Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another &#39;s burning; r n One pain is lessoned by another &#39;s anguish; r n Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; r n One desperate grief cures with another &#39;s languish. r n Take thou some new infection to thy eye, r n And the rank poison of the old will die. r n r n Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that. r n r n Ben. For what, I pray thee? r n r n Rom. For your broken shin. r n r n Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? r n r n Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; r n Shut up in Prison, kept without my food, r n Whipp &#39;d and tormented and- God-den, good fellow. r n r n Serv. God gi &#39; go-den. I pray, sir, can you read? r n r n Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. r n r n Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can r n you read anything you see? r n r n Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language. r n r n Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry! r n r n Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read. He reads. r n r n &#39;Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; r n County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; r n The lady widow of Vitruvio; r n Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces; r n Mercutio and his brother Valentine; r n Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters; r n My fair niece Rosaline and Livia; r n Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt; r n Lucio and the lively Helena. &#39; r n r n [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they r n come? r n r n Serv. Up. r n r n Rom. Whither? r n r n Serv. To supper, to our house. r n r n Rom. Whose house? r n r n Serv. My master &#39;s. r n r n Rom. Indeed I should have ask &#39;d you that before. r n r n Serv. Now I &#39;ll tell you without asking. My master is the great r n rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray r n come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! Exit. r n r n Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet &#39;s r n Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov &#39;st; r n With all the admired beauties of Verona. r n Go thither, and with unattainted eye r n Compare her face with some that I shall show, r n And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. r n r n Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye r n Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; r n And these, who, often drown &#39;d, could never die, r n Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! r n One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun r n Ne &#39;er saw her match since first the world begun. r n r n Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by, r n Herself pois &#39;d with herself in either eye; r n But in that crystal scales let there be weigh &#39;d r n Your lady &#39;s love against some other maid r n That I will show you shining at this feast, r n And she shall scant show well that now seems best. r n r n Rom. I &#39;ll go along, no such sight to be shown, r n But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.] r n r n r n r n r nScene III. r nCapulet &#39;s house. r n r nEnter Capulet &#39;s Wife, and Nurse. r n r n r n Wife. Nurse, where &#39;s my daughter? Call her forth to me. r n r n Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old, r n I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird! r n God forbid! Where &#39;s this girl? What, Juliet! r n r n Enter Juliet. r n r n r n Jul. How now? Who calls? r n r n Nurse. Your mother. r n r n Jul. Madam, I am here. r n What is your will? r n r n Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile, r n We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; r n I have rememb &#39;red me, thou &#39;s hear our counsel. r n Thou knowest my daughter &#39;s of a pretty age. r n r n Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. r n r n Wife. She &#39;s not fourteen. r n r n Nurse. I &#39;ll lay fourteen of my teeth- r n And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four- r n She is not fourteen. How long is it now r n To Lammastide? r n r n Wife. A fortnight and odd days. r n r n Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year, r n Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. r n Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!) r n Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; r n She was too good for me. But, as I said, r n On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen; r n That shall she, marry; I remember it well. r n &#39;Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; r n And she was wean &#39;d (I never shall forget it), r n Of all the days of the year, upon that day; r n For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, r n Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall. r n My lord and you were then at Mantua. r n Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said, r n When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple r n Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, r n To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! r n Shake, quoth the dovehouse! &#39;Twas no need, I trow, r n To bid me trudge. r n And since that time it is eleven years, r n For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th &#39; rood, r n She could have run and waddled all about; r n For even the day before, she broke her brow; r n And then my husband (God be with his soul! r n &#39;A was a merry man) took up the child. r n &#39;Yea, &#39; quoth he, &#39;dost thou fall upon thy face? r n Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; r n Wilt thou not, Jule? &#39; and, by my holidam, r n The pretty wretch left crying, and said &#39;Ay. &#39; r n To see now how a jest shall come about! r n I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas, r n I never should forget it. &#39;Wilt thou not, Jule? &#39; quoth he, r n And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said &#39;Ay. &#39; r n r n Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace. r n r n Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh r n To think it should leave crying and say &#39;Ay. &#39; r n And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow r n A bump as big as a young cock &#39;rel &#39;s stone; r n A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly. r n &#39;Yea, &#39; quoth my husband, &#39;fall &#39;st upon thy face? r n Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; r n Wilt thou not, Jule? &#39; It stinted, and said &#39;Ay. &#39; r n r n Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. r n r n Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! r n Thou wast the prettiest babe that e &#39;er I nurs &#39;d. r n An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. r n r n Wife. Marry, that &#39;marry &#39; is the very theme r n I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, r n How stands your disposition to be married? r n r n Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of. r n r n Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse, r n I would say thou hadst suck &#39;d wisdom from thy teat. r n r n Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you, r n Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, r n Are made already mothers. By my count, r n I was your mother much upon these years r n That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: r n The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. r n r n Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man r n As all the world- why he &#39;s a man of wax. r n r n Wife. Verona &#39;s summer hath not such a flower. r n r n Nurse. Nay, he &#39;s a flower, in faith- a very flower. r n r n Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman? r n This night you shall behold him at our feast. r n Read o &#39;er the volume of young Paris &#39; face, r n And find delight writ there with beauty &#39;s pen; r n Examine every married lineament, r n And see how one another lends content; r n And what obscur &#39;d in this fair volume lies r n Find written in the margent of his eyes, r n This precious book of love, this unbound lover, r n To beautify him only lacks a cover. r n The fish lives in the sea, and &#39;tis much pride r n For fair without the fair within to hide. r n That book in many &#39;s eyes doth share the glory, r n That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; r n So shall you share all that he doth possess, r n By having him making yourself no less. r n r n Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men r n r n Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris &#39; love? r n r n Jul. I &#39;ll look to like, if looking liking move; r n But no more deep will I endart mine eye r n Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. r n r n Enter Servingman. r n r n r n Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv &#39;d up, you call &#39;d, r n my young lady ask &#39;d for, the nurse curs &#39;d in the pantry, and r n everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you r n follow straight. r n r n Wife. We follow thee. Exit [Servingman]. r n Juliet, the County stays. r n r n Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. r n Exeunt. r n r n r n r n r nScene IV. r nA street. r n r nEnter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; r nTorchbearers. r n r n r n Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? r n Or shall we on without apology? r n r n Ben. The date is out of such prolixity. r n We &#39;ll have no Cupid hoodwink &#39;d with a scarf, r n Bearing a Tartar &#39;s painted bow of lath, r n Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper; r n Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke r n After the prompter, for our entrance; r n But, let them measure us by what they will, r n We &#39;ll measure them a measure, and be gone. r n r n Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling. r n Being but heavy, I will bear the light. r n r n Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. r n r n Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes r n With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead r n So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. r n r n Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid &#39;s wings r n And soar with them above a common bound. r n r n Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft r n To soar with his light feathers; and so bound r n I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. r n Under love &#39;s heavy burthen do I sink. r n r n Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love- r n Too great oppression for a tender thing. r n r n Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, r n Too rude, too boist &#39;rous, and it pricks like thorn. r n r n Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love. r n Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. r n Give me a case to put my visage in. r n A visor for a visor! What care I r n What curious eye doth quote deformities? r n Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. r n r n Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in r n But every man betake him to his legs. r n r n Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart r n Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels; r n For I am proverb &#39;d with a grandsire phrase, r n I &#39;ll be a candle-holder and look on; r n The game was ne &#39;er so fair, and I am done. r n r n Mer. Tut! dun &#39;s the mouse, the constable &#39;s own word! r n If thou art Dun, we &#39;ll draw thee from the mire r n Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick &#39;st r n Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! r n r n Rom. Nay, that &#39;s not so. r n r n Mer. I mean, sir, in delay r n We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. r n Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits r n Five times in that ere once in our five wits. r n r n Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque; r n But &#39;tis no wit to go. r n r n Mer. Why, may one ask? r n r n Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night. r n r n Mer. And so did I. r n r n Rom. Well, what was yours? r n r n Mer. That dreamers often lie. r n r n Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. r n r n Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you. r n She is the fairies &#39; midwife, and she comes r n In shape no bigger than an agate stone r n On the forefinger of an alderman, r n Drawn with a team of little atomies r n Athwart men &#39;s noses as they lie asleep; r n Her wagon spokes made of long spinners &#39; legs, r n The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; r n Her traces, of the smallest spider &#39;s web; r n Her collars, of the moonshine &#39;s wat &#39;ry beams; r n Her whip, of cricket &#39;s bone; the lash, of film; r n Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, r n Not half so big as a round little worm r n Prick &#39;d from the lazy finger of a maid; r n Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, r n Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, r n Time out o &#39; mind the fairies &#39; coachmakers. r n And in this state she &#39;gallops night by night r n Through lovers &#39; brains, and then they dream of love; r n O &#39;er courtiers &#39; knees, that dream on cursies straight; r n O &#39;er lawyers &#39; fingers, who straight dream on fees; r n O &#39;er ladies &#39; lips, who straight on kisses dream, r n Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, r n Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. r n Sometime she gallops o &#39;er a courtier &#39;s nose, r n And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; r n And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig &#39;s tail r n Tickling a parson &#39;s nose as &#39;a lies asleep, r n Then dreams he of another benefice. r n Sometimes she driveth o &#39;er a soldier &#39;s neck, r n And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, r n Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, r n Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon r n Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, r n And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two r n And sleeps again. This is that very Mab r n That plats the manes of horses in the night r n And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs, r n Which once untangled much misfortune bodes r n This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, r n That presses them and learns them first to bear, r n Making them women of good carriage. r n This is she- r n r n Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! r n Thou talk &#39;st of nothing. r n r n Mer. True, I talk of dreams; r n Which are the children of an idle brain, r n Begot of nothing but vain fantasy; r n Which is as thin of substance as the air, r n And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes r n Even now the frozen bosom of the North r n And, being anger &#39;d, puffs away from thence, r n Turning his face to the dew-dropping South. r n r n Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves. r n Supper is done, and we shall come too late. r n r n Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives r n Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, r n Shall bitterly begin his fearful date r n With this night &#39;s revels and expire the term r n Of a despised life, clos &#39;d in my breast, r n By some vile forfeit of untimely death. r n But he that hath the steerage of my course r n Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen! r n r n Ben. Strike, drum. r n They march about the stage. [Exeunt.] r n r n r n r n r nScene V. r nCapulet &#39;s house. r n r nServingmen come forth with napkins. r n r n 1.

When good manners shall lie all in one or two men &#39;s r n hands, and they unwash &#39;d too, &#39;tis a foul thing. r n 1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert, r n look to the plate.

What, man? &#39;Tis not so much, &#39;tis not so much! r n &#39;Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, r n Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, r n Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask &#39;d. r n 2. Cap. &#39;Tis more, &#39;tis more! His son is elder, sir; r n His son is thirty. r n r n Cap. Will you tell me that? r n His son was but a ward two years ago. r n r n Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady &#39;s that, which doth enrich the r n hand Of yonder knight? r n r n Serv. I know not, sir. r n r n Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! r n It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night r n Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop &#39;s ear- r n Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! r n So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows r n As yonder lady o &#39;er her fellows shows. r n The measure done, I &#39;ll watch her place of stand r n And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. r n Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! r n For I ne &#39;er saw true beauty till this night. r n r n Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague. r n Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave r n Come hither, cover &#39;d with an antic face, r n To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? r n Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, r n To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. r n r n Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so? r n r n Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe; r n A villain, that is hither come in spite r n To scorn at our solemnity this night. r n r n Cap. Young Romeo is it? r n r n Tyb. &#39;Tis he, that villain Romeo. r n r n Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone. r n &#39;A bears him like a portly gentleman, r n And, to say truth, Verona brags of him r n To be a virtuous and well-govern &#39;d youth. r n I would not for the wealth of all this town r n Here in my house do him disparagement. r n Therefore be patient, take no note of him. r n It is my will; the which if thou respect, r n Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, r n An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. r n r n Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest. r n I &#39;ll not endure him. r n r n Cap. He shall be endur &#39;d. r n What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to! r n Am I the master here, or you? Go to! r n You &#39;ll not endure him? God shall mend my soul! r n You &#39;ll make a mutiny among my guests! r n You will set cock-a-hoop! you &#39;ll be the man! r n r n Tyb.

Marry, &#39;tis time.- r n Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go! r n Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame! r n I &#39;ll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts! r n r n Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting r n Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. r n I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall, r n Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt &#39;rest gall. Exit. r n r n Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand r n This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: r n My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand r n To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. r n r n Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, r n Which mannerly devotion shows in this; r n For saints have hands that pilgrims &#39; hands do touch, r n And palm to palm is holy palmers &#39; kiss. r n r n Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? r n r n Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray &#39;r. r n r n Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do! r n They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. r n r n Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers &#39; sake. r n r n Rom. Then move not while my prayer &#39;s effect I take. r n Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg &#39;d. [Kisses her.] r n r n Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. r n r n Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg &#39;d! r n Give me my sin again. [Kisses her.] r n r n Jul. You kiss by th &#39; book. r n r n Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you. r n r n Rom.

He jests at scars that never felt a wound. r n r n Enter Juliet above at a window. r n r n But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? r n It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! r n Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, r n Who is already sick and pale with grief r n That thou her maid art far more fair than she. r n Be not her maid, since she is envious. r n Her vestal livery is but sick and green, r n And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off. r n It is my lady; O, it is my love! r n O that she knew she were! r n She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that? r n Her eye discourses; I will answer it. r n I am too bold; &#39;tis not to me she speaks. r n Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, r n Having some business, do entreat her eyes r n To twinkle in their spheres till they return. r n What if her eyes were there, they in her head? r n The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars r n As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven r n Would through the airy region stream so bright r n That birds would sing and think it were not night. r n See how she leans her cheek upon her hand! r n O that I were a glove upon that hand, r n That I might touch that cheek! r n r n Jul.

O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? r n Deny thy father and refuse thy name! r n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, r n And I &#39;ll no longer be a Capulet. r n r n Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? r n r n Jul. &#39;Tis but thy name that is my enemy. r n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. r n What &#39;s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, r n Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part r n Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! r n What &#39;s in a name? That which we call a rose r n By any other name would smell as sweet. r n So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call &#39;d, r n Retain that dear perfection which he owes r n Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name; r n And for that name, which is no part of thee, r n Take all myself. r n r n Rom. I take thee at thy word. r n Call me but love, and I &#39;ll be new baptiz &#39;d; r n Henceforth I never will be Romeo. r n r n Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen &#39;d in night, r n So stumblest on my counsel? r n r n Rom. By a name r n I know not how to tell thee who I am. r n My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, r n Because it is an enemy to thee. r n Had I it written, I would tear the word. r n r n Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words r n Of that tongue &#39;s utterance, yet I know the sound. r n Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? r n r n Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. r n r n Jul. How cam &#39;st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? r n The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, r n And the place death, considering who thou art, r n If any of my kinsmen find thee here. r n r n Rom. With love &#39;s light wings did I o &#39;erperch these walls; r n For stony limits cannot hold love out, r n And what love can do, that dares love attempt. r n Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. r n r n Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee. r n r n Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye r n Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, r n And I am proof against their enmity. r n r n Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here. r n r n Rom. I have night &#39;s cloak to hide me from their sight; r n And but thou love me, let them find me here. r n My life were better ended by their hate r n Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. r n r n Jul. By whose direction found &#39;st thou out this place? r n r n Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire. r n He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. r n I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far r n As that vast shore wash &#39;d with the farthest sea, r n I would adventure for such merchandise. r n r n Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face; r n Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek r n For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night. r n Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny r n What I have spoke; but farewell compliment! r n Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say &#39;Ay &#39;; r n And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear &#39;st, r n Thou mayst prove false. At lovers &#39; perjuries, r n They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, r n If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. r n Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won, r n I &#39;ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, r n So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. r n In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, r n And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light; r n But trust me, gentleman, I &#39;ll prove more true r n Than those that have more cunning to be strange. r n I should have been more strange, I must confess, r n But that thou overheard &#39;st, ere I was ware, r n My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me, r n And not impute this yielding to light love, r n Which the dark night hath so discovered. r n r n Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear, r n That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops- r n r n Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th &#39; inconstant moon, r n That monthly changes in her circled orb, r n Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. r n r n Rom. What shall I swear by? r n r n Jul. Do not swear at all; r n Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, r n Which is the god of my idolatry, r n And I &#39;ll believe thee. r n r n Rom. If my heart &#39;s dear love- r n r n Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, r n I have no joy of this contract to-night. r n It is too rash, too unadvis &#39;d, too sudden; r n Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be r n Ere one can say &#39;It lightens. &#39; Sweet, good night! r n This bud of love, by summer &#39;s ripening breath, r n May prove a beauteous flow &#39;r when next we meet. r n Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest r n Come to thy heart as that within my breast! r n r n Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? r n r n Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? r n r n Rom. Th &#39; exchange of thy love &#39;s faithful vow for mine. r n r n Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it; r n And yet I would it were to give again. r n r n Rom. Would &#39;st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love? r n r n Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again. r n And yet I wish but for the thing I have. r n My bounty is as boundless as the sea, r n My love as deep; the more I give to thee, r n The more I have, for both are infinite. r n I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu! r n [Nurse] calls within. r n Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. r n Stay but a little, I will come again. [Exit.] r n r n Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard, r n Being in night, all this is but a dream, r n Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. r n r n Enter Juliet above. r n r n r n Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. r n If that thy bent of love be honourable, r n Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, r n By one that I &#39;ll procure to come to thee, r n Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; r n And all my fortunes at thy foot I &#39;ll lay r n And follow thee my lord throughout the world. r n r n Nurse. (within) Madam! r n r n Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well, r n I do beseech thee- r n r n Nurse. (within) Madam! r n r n Jul. By-and-by I come.- r n To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief. r n To-morrow will I send. r n r n Rom. So thrive my soul- r n r n Jul. A thousand times good night! Exit. r n r n Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light! r n Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; r n But love from love, towards school with heavy looks. r n r n Enter Juliet again, [above]. r n r n r n Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer &#39;s voice r n To lure this tassel-gentle back again! r n Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud; r n Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, r n And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine r n With repetition of my Romeo &#39;s name. r n Romeo! r n r n Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name. r n How silver-sweet sound lovers &#39; tongues by night, r n Like softest music to attending ears! r n r n Jul. Romeo! r n r n Rom. My dear? r n r n Jul. At what o &#39;clock to-morrow r n Shall I send to thee? r n r n Rom. By the hour of nine. r n r n Jul. I will not fail. &#39;Tis twenty years till then. r n I have forgot why I did call thee back. r n r n Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it. r n r n Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, r n Rememb &#39;ring how I love thy company. r n r n Rom. And I &#39;ll still stay, to have thee still forget, r n Forgetting any other home but this. r n r n Jul. &#39;Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone- r n And yet no farther than a wanton &#39;s bird, r n That lets it hop a little from her hand, r n Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, r n And with a silk thread plucks it back again, r n So loving-jealous of his liberty. r n r n Rom. I would I were thy bird. r n r n Jul. Sweet, so would I. r n Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. r n Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow, r n That I shall say good night till it be morrow. r n [Exit.] r n r n Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! r n Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! r n Hence will I to my ghostly father &#39;s cell, r n His help to crave and my dear hap to tell. r n Exit r n r n r n r n r nScene III. r nFriar Laurence &#39;s cell. r n r nEnter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket. r n r n r n Friar. The grey-ey &#39;d morn smiles on the frowning night, r n Check &#39;ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light; r n And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels r n From forth day &#39;s path and Titan &#39;s fiery wheels. r n Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye r n The day to cheer and night &#39;s dank dew to dry, r n I must up-fill this osier cage of ours r n With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. r n The earth that &#39;s nature &#39;s mother is her tomb. r n What is her burying gave, that is her womb; r n And from her womb children of divers kind r n We sucking on her natural bosom find; r n Many for many virtues excellent, r n None but for some, and yet all different. r n O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies r n In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities; r n For naught so vile that on the earth doth live r n But to the earth some special good doth give; r n Nor aught so good but, strain &#39;d from that fair use, r n Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. r n Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, r n And vice sometime &#39;s by action dignified. r n Within the infant rind of this small flower r n Poison hath residence, and medicine power; r n For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; r n Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. r n Two such opposed kings encamp them still r n In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will; r n And where the worser is predominant, r n Full soon the canker death eats up that plant. r n r n Enter Romeo. r n r n r n Rom. Good morrow, father. r n r n Friar. Benedicite! r n What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? r n Young son, it argues a distempered head r n So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. r n Care keeps his watch in every old man &#39;s eye, r n And where care lodges sleep will never lie; r n But where unbruised youth with unstuff &#39;d brain r n Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign. r n Therefore thy earliness doth me assure r n Thou art uprous &#39;d with some distemp &#39;rature; r n Or if not so, then here I hit it right- r n Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night. r n r n Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine. r n r n Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline? r n r n Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No. r n I have forgot that name, and that name &#39;s woe. r n r n Friar. That &#39;s my good son! But where hast thou been then? r n r n Rom. I &#39;ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again. r n I have been feasting with mine enemy, r n Where on a sudden one hath wounded me r n That &#39;s by me wounded. Both our remedies r n Within thy help and holy physic lies. r n I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, r n My intercession likewise steads my foe. r n r n Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift r n Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. r n r n Rom. Then plainly know my heart &#39;s dear love is set r n On the fair daughter of rich Capulet; r n As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, r n And all combin &#39;d, save what thou must combine r n By holy marriage. When, and where, and how r n We met, we woo &#39;d, and made exchange of vow, r n I &#39;ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, r n That thou consent to marry us to-day. r n r n Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here! r n Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, r n So soon forsaken? Young men &#39;s love then lies r n Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. r n Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine r n Hath wash &#39;d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! r n How much salt water thrown away in waste, r n To season love, that of it doth not taste! r n The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, r n Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears. r n Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit r n Of an old tear that is not wash &#39;d off yet. r n If e &#39;er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, r n Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline. r n And art thou chang &#39;d? Pronounce this sentence then: r n Women may fall when there &#39;s no strength in men. r n r n Rom. Thou chid &#39;st me oft for loving Rosaline. r n r n Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. r n r n Rom. And bad &#39;st me bury love. r n r n Friar. Not in a grave r n To lay one in, another out to have. r n r n Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now r n Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. r n The other did not so. r n r n Friar. O, she knew well r n Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. r n But come, young waverer, come go with me. r n In one respect I &#39;ll thy assistant be; r n For this alliance may so happy prove r n To turn your households &#39; rancour to pure love. r n r n Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste. r n r n Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast. r n Exeunt. r n r n r n r n r nScene IV. r nA street. r n r nEnter Benvolio and Mercutio. r n r n r n Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be? r n Came he not home to-night? r n r n Ben. Not to his father &#39;s. I spoke with his man. r n r n Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, r n Torments him so that he will sure run mad. r n r n Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, r n Hath sent a letter to his father &#39;s house. r n r n Mer. A challenge, on my life. r n r n Ben. Romeo will answer it. r n r n Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter. r n r n Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter &#39;s master, how he dares, r n being dared. r n r n Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb &#39;d with a white r n wench &#39;s black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the r n very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy &#39;s r n butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt? r n r n Ben. Why, what is Tybalt? r n r n Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he &#39;s the r n courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing r n pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his r n minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very r n butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman r n of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the r n immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay. r n r n Ben. The what? r n r n Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes- r n these new tuners of accent! &#39;By Jesu, a very good blade! a very r n tall man! a very good whore! &#39; Why, is not this a lamentable thing, r n grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange r n flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi &#39;s, who stand r n so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old r n bench? O, their bones, their bones! r n r n Enter Romeo. r n r n r n Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo! r n r n Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how r n art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch r n flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she r n had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy, r n Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so, r n but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There &#39;s a French r n salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit r n fairly last night. r n r n Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you? r n r n Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive? r n r n Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a r n case as mine a man may strain courtesy. r n r n Mer. That &#39;s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a r n man to bow in the hams. r n r n Rom. Meaning, to cursy. r n r n Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it. r n r n Rom. A most courteous exposition. r n r n Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. r n r n Rom. Pink for flower. r n r n Mer. Right. r n r n Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower &#39;d. r n r n Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out r n thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may r n remain, after the wearing, solely singular. r n r n Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness! r n r n Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint. r n r n Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I &#39;ll cry a match. r n r n Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for r n thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am r n sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose? r n r n Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not r n there for the goose. r n r n Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest. r n r n Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not! r n r n Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce. r n r n Rom. And is it not, then, well serv &#39;d in to a sweet goose? r n r n Mer. O, here &#39;s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch r n narrow to an ell broad! r n r n Rom. I stretch it out for that word &#39;broad, &#39; which, added to r n the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. r n r n Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now r n art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by r n art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a r n great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in r n a hole. r n r n Ben. Stop there, stop there! r n r n Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. r n r n Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. r n r n Mer. O, thou art deceiv &#39;d! I would have made it short; for I r n was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to r n occupy the argument no longer. r n r n Rom. Here &#39;s goodly gear! r n r n Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter]. r n r n r n Mer. A sail, a sail! r n r n Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock. r n r n Nurse. Peter! r n r n Peter. Anon. r n r n Nurse. My fan, Peter. r n r n Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan &#39;s the fairer face of r n the two. r n r n Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen. r n r n Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman. r n r n Nurse. Is it good-den? r n r n Mer. &#39;Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is r n now upon the prick of noon. r n r n Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you! r n r n Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar. r n r n Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. &#39;For himself to mar, &#39; r n quoth &#39;a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the r n young Romeo? r n r n Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you r n have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest r n of that name, for fault of a worse. r n r n Nurse. You say well. r n r n Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i &#39; faith! wisely, r n wisely. r n r n Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you. r n r n Ben. She will endite him to some supper. r n r n Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho! r n r n Rom. What hast thou found? r n r n Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is r n something stale and hoar ere it be spent r n He walks by them and sings. r n r n An old hare hoar, r n And an old hare hoar, r n Is very good meat in Lent; r n But a hare that is hoar r n Is too much for a score r n When it hoars ere it be spent. r n r n Romeo, will you come to your father &#39;s? We &#39;ll to dinner thither. r n r n Rom. I will follow you. r n r n Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell, r n [sings] lady, lady, lady. r n Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio. r n r n Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant r n was this that was so full of his ropery? r n r n Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and r n will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month. r n r n Nurse. An &#39;a speak anything against me, I &#39;ll take him down, an r n &#39;a r n were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot, r n I &#39;ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his r n flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must r n stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure! r n r n Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my r n weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as r n soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the r n law on my side. r n r n Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me r n quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you, r n my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I r n will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead r n her into a fool &#39;s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of r n behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and r n therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were r n an ill thing to be off &#39;red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. r n r n Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto r n thee- r n r n Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord, r n Lord! she will be a joyful woman. r n r n Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me. r n r n Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I r n take it, is a gentlemanlike offer. r n r n Rom. Bid her devise r n Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; r n And there she shall at Friar Laurence &#39; cell r n Be shriv &#39;d and married. Here is for thy pains. r n r n Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny. r n r n Rom. Go to! I say you shall. r n r n Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there. r n r n Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall. r n Within this hour my man shall be with thee r n And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, r n Which to the high topgallant of my joy r n Must be my convoy in the secret night. r n Farewell. Be trusty, and I &#39;ll quit thy pains. r n Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress. r n r n Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir. r n r n Rom. What say &#39;st thou, my dear nurse? r n r n Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne &#39;er hear say, r n Two may keep counsel, putting one away? r n r n Rom. I warrant thee my man &#39;s as true as steel. r n r n Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! r n when &#39;twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in r n town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, r n good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I r n anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man; r n but I &#39;ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any r n clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both r n with a letter? r n r n Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R. r n r n Nurse. Ah, mocker! that &#39;s the dog &#39;s name. R is for the- No; I r n know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest r n sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you r n good to hear it. r n r n Rom. Commend me to thy lady. r n r n Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter! r n r n Peter. Anon. r n r n Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace. r n Exeunt. r n r n r n r n r nScene V. r nCapulet &#39;s orchard. r n r nEnter Juliet. r n r n r n Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse; r n In half an hour she &#39;promis &#39;d to return. r n Perchance she cannot meet him. That &#39;s not so. r n O, she is lame! Love &#39;s heralds should be thoughts, r n Which ten times faster glide than the sun &#39;s beams r n Driving back shadows over low &#39;ring hills. r n Therefore do nimble-pinion &#39;d doves draw Love, r n And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. r n Now is the sun upon the highmost hill r n Of this day &#39;s journey, and from nine till twelve r n Is three long hours; yet she is not come. r n Had she affections and warm youthful blood, r n She would be as swift in motion as a ball; r n My words would bandy her to my sweet love, r n And his to me, r n But old folks, many feign as they were dead- r n Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. r n r n Enter Nurse [and Peter]. r n r n O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news? r n Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. r n r n Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate. r n [Exit Peter.] r n r n Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look &#39;st thou sad? r n Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; r n If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news r n By playing it to me with so sour a face. r n r n Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile. r n Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had! r n r n Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news. r n Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak. r n r n Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile? r n Do you not see that I am out of breath? r n r n Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath r n To say to me that thou art out of breath? r n The excuse that thou dost make in this delay r n Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. r n Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that. r n Say either, and I &#39;ll stay the circumstance. r n Let me be satisfied, is &#39;t good or bad? r n r n Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to r n choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better r n than any man &#39;s, yet his leg excels all men &#39;s; and for a hand and a r n foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk &#39;d on, yet r n they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I &#39;ll r n warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve r nGod. r n What, have you din &#39;d at home? r n r n Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before. r n What says he of our marriage? What of that? r n r n Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I! r n It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. r n My back o &#39; t &#39; other side,- ah, my back, my back! r n Beshrew your heart for sending me about r n To catch my death with jauncing up and down! r n r n Jul. I &#39; faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. r n Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? r n r n Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, r n and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where r n is your mother? r n r n Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within. r n Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest! r n &#39;Your love says, like an honest gentleman, r n &#34;Where is your mother?&#34; &#39; r n r n Nurse. O God &#39;s Lady dear! r n Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow. r n Is this the poultice for my aching bones? r n Henceforward do your messages yourself. r n r n Jul. Here &#39;s such a coil! Come, what says Romeo? r n r n Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day? r n r n Jul. I have. r n r n Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence &#39; cell; r n There stays a husband to make you a wife. r n Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks: r n They &#39;ll be in scarlet straight at any news. r n Hie you to church; I must another way, r n To fetch a ladder, by the which your love r n Must climb a bird &#39;s nest soon when it is dark. r n I am the drudge, and toil in your delight; r n But you shall bear the burthen soon at night. r n Go; I &#39;ll to dinner; hie you to the cell. r n r n Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell. r n Exeunt. r n r n r n r n r nScene VI. r nFriar Laurence &#39;s cell. r n r nEnter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo. r n r n r n Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act r n That after-hours with sorrow chide us not! r n r n Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can, r n It cannot countervail the exchange of joy r n That one short minute gives me in her sight. r n Do thou but close our hands with holy words, r n Then love-devouring death do what he dare- r n It is enough I may but call her mine. r n r n Friar. These violent delights have violent ends r n And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, r n Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey r n Is loathsome in his own deliciousness r n And in the taste confounds the appetite. r n Therefore love moderately: long love doth so; r n Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. r n r n Enter Juliet. r n r n Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot r n Will ne &#39;er wear out the everlasting flint. r n A lover may bestride the gossamer r n That idles in the wanton summer air, r n And yet not fall; so light is vanity. r n r n Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor. r n r n Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. r n r n Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much. r n r n Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy r n Be heap &#39;d like mine, and that thy skill be more r n To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath r n This neighbour air, and let rich music &#39;s tongue r n Unfold the imagin &#39;d happiness that both r n Receive in either by this dear encounter. r n r n Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, r n Brags of his substance, not of ornament. r n They are but beggars that can count their worth; r n But my true love is grown to such excess r n cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. r n r n Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work; r n For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone r n Till Holy Church incorporate two in one. r n [Exeunt.] r n r n r n r n r nACT III. Scene I. r nA public place. r n r nEnter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men. r n r n r n Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let &#39;s retire. r n The day is hot, the Capulets abroad. r n And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl, r n For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. r n r n Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters r n the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and r n says &#39;God send me no need of thee! &#39; and by the operation of the r n second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. r n r n Ben. Am I like such a fellow? r n r n Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in r n Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be r n moved. r n r n Ben. And what to? r n r n Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, r n for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a r n man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. r n Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no r n other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an r n eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels r n as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as r n addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell &#39;d with a r n man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog r n that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a r n tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with r n another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt r n tutor me from quarrelling! r n r n Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should r n buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. r n r n Mer.

A gentler judgment vanish &#39;d from his lips- r n Not body &#39;s death, but body &#39;s banishment. r n r n Rom. Ha, banishment?

Hence from Verona art thou banished. r n Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. r n r n Rom. There is no world without Verona walls, r n But purgatory, torture, hell itself. r n Hence banished is banish &#39;d from the world, r n And world &#39;s exile is death. Then &#39;banishment &#39; r n Is death misterm &#39;d. Calling death &#39;banishment, &#39; r n Thou cut &#39;st my head off with a golden axe r n And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. r n r n Friar. O deadly sin!

Heaven is here, r n Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog r n And little mouse, every unworthy thing, r n Live here in heaven and may look on her; r n But Romeo may not. More validity, r n More honourable state, more courtship lives r n In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize r n On the white wonder of dear Juliet &#39;s hand r n And steal immortal blessing from her lips, r n Who, even in pure and vestal modesty, r n Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; r n But Romeo may not- he is banished. r n This may flies do, when I from this must fly; r n They are free men, but I am banished. r n And sayest thou yet that exile is not death? r n Hadst thou no poison mix &#39;d, no sharp-ground knife, r n No sudden mean of death, though ne &#39;er so mean, r n But &#39;banished &#39; to kill me- &#39;banished &#39;? r n O friar, the damned use that word in hell; r n Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart, r n Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, r n A sin-absolver, and my friend profess &#39;d, r n To mangle me with that word &#39;banished &#39;? r n r n Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak. r n r n Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. r n r n Friar. I &#39;ll give thee armour to keep off that word; r n Adversity &#39;s sweet milk, philosophy, r n To comfort thee, though thou art banished. r n r n Rom. Yet &#39;banished &#39;? Hang up philosophy! r n Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, r n Displant a town, reverse a prince &#39;s doom, r n It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more. r n r n Friar.

I think she will be rul &#39;d r n In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not. r n Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; r n Acquaint her here of my son Paris &#39; love r n And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next- r n But, soft! what day is this? r n r n Par. Monday, my lord. r n r n Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon. r n Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her r n She shall be married to this noble earl. r n Will you be ready? Do you like this haste? r n We &#39;ll keep no great ado- a friend or two; r n For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, r n It may be thought we held him carelessly, r n Being our kinsman, if we revel much. r n Therefore we &#39;ll have some half a dozen friends, r n And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? r n r n Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow. r n r n Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then. r n Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed; r n Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day. r n Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho! r n Afore me, It is so very very late r n That we may call it early by-and-by. r n Good night. r n Exeunt r n r n r n r n r nScene V. r nCapulet &#39;s orchard. r n r nEnter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window. r n r n r n Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day. r n It was the nightingale, and not the lark, r n That pierc &#39;d the fearful hollow of thine ear. r n Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree. r n Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. r n r n Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn; r n No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks r n Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East. r n Night &#39;s candles are burnt out, and jocund day r n Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. r n I must be gone and live, or stay and die. r n r n Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I. r n It is some meteor that the sun exhales r n To be to thee this night a torchbearer r n And light thee on the way to Mantua. r n Therefore stay yet; thou need &#39;st not to be gone. r n r n Rom. Let me be ta &#39;en, let me be put to death. r n I am content, so thou wilt have it so. r n I &#39;ll say yon grey is not the morning &#39;s eye, r n &#39;Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia &#39;s brow; r n Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat r n The vaulty heaven so high above our heads. r n I have more care to stay than will to go. r n Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. r n How is &#39;t, my soul? Let &#39;s talk; it is not day. r n r n Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away! r n It is the lark that sings so out of tune, r n Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. r n Some say the lark makes sweet division; r n This doth not so, for she divideth us. r n Some say the lark and loathed toad chang &#39;d eyes; r n O, now I would they had chang &#39;d voices too, r n Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, r n Hunting thee hence with hunt &#39;s-up to the day! r n O, now be gone! More light and light it grows. r n r n Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes! r n r n Enter Nurse. r n r n r n Nurse. Madam! r n r n Jul. Nurse? r n r n Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber. r n The day is broke; be wary, look about. r n r n Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out. r n [Exit.] r n r n Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I &#39;ll descend. r n He goeth down. r n r n Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend? r n I must hear from thee every day in the hour, r n For in a minute there are many days. r n O, by this count I shall be much in years r n Ere I again behold my Romeo! r n r n Rom. Farewell! r n I will omit no opportunity r n That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. r n r n Jul. O, think &#39;st thou we shall ever meet again? r n r n Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve r n For sweet discourses in our time to come. r n r n Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul! r n Methinks I see thee, now thou art below, r n As one dead in the bottom of a tomb. r n Either my eyesight fails, or thou look &#39;st pale. r n r n Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you. r n Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu! r nExit. r n r n Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle. r n If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him r n That is renown &#39;d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune, r n For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long r n But send him back. r n r n Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up? r n r n Jul. Who is &#39;t that calls? It is my lady mother. r n Is she not down so late, or up so early? r n What unaccustom &#39;d cause procures her hither? r n r n Enter Mother. r n r n r n Lady. Why, how now, Juliet? r n r n Jul. Madam, I am not well. r n r n Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin &#39;s death? r n What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? r n An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live. r n Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love; r n But much of grief shows still some want of wit. r n r n Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. r n r n Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend r n Which you weep for. r n r n Jul. Feeling so the loss, r n I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. r n r n Lady. Well, girl, thou weep &#39;st not so much for his death r n As that the villain lives which slaughter &#39;d him. r n r n Jul. What villain, madam? r n r n Lady. That same villain Romeo. r n r n Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.- r n God pardon him! I do, with all my heart; r n And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. r n r n Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives. r n r n Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. r n Would none but I might venge my cousin &#39;s death! r n r n Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not. r n Then weep no more. I &#39;ll send to one in Mantua, r n Where that same banish &#39;d runagate doth live, r n Shall give him such an unaccustom &#39;d dram r n That he shall soon keep Tybalt company; r n And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied. r n r n Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied r n With Romeo till I behold him- dead- r n Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex &#39;d. r n Madam, if you could find out but a man r n To bear a poison, I would temper it; r n That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, r n Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors r n To hear him nam &#39;d and cannot come to him, r n To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt r n Upon his body that hath slaughter &#39;d him! r n r n Lady. Find thou the means, and I &#39;ll find such a man. r n But now I &#39;ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. r n r n Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time. r n What are they, I beseech your ladyship? r n r n Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; r n One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, r n Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy r n That thou expects not nor I look &#39;d not for. r n r n Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that? r n r n Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn r n The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, r n The County Paris, at Saint Peter &#39;s Church, r n Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. r n r n Jul. Now by Saint Peter &#39;s Church, and Peter too, r n He shall not make me there a joyful bride! r n I wonder at this haste, that I must wed r n Ere he that should be husband comes to woo. r n I pray you tell my lord and father, madam, r n I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear r n It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, r n Rather than Paris. These are news indeed! r n r n Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself, r n And see how he will take it at your hands. r n r n Enter Capulet and Nurse. r n r n r n Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew, r n But for the sunset of my brother &#39;s son r n It rains downright. r n How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears? r n Evermore show &#39;ring? In one little body r n Thou counterfeit &#39;st a bark, a sea, a wind: r n For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, r n Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is r n Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs, r n Who, raging with thy tears and they with them, r n Without a sudden calm will overset r n Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife? r n Have you delivered to her our decree? r n r n Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. r n I would the fool were married to her grave! r n r n Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. r n How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks? r n Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, r n Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought r n So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? r n r n Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. r n Proud can I never be of what I hate, r n But thankful even for hate that is meant love. r n r n Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this? r n &#39;Proud &#39;- and &#39;I thank you &#39;- and &#39;I thank you not &#39;- r n And yet &#39;not proud &#39;? Mistress minion you, r n Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, r n But fettle your fine joints &#39;gainst Thursday next r n To go with Paris to Saint Peter &#39;s Church, r n Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. r n Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage! r n You tallow-face! r n r n Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad? r n r n Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees, r n Hear me with patience but to speak a word. r n r n Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch! r n I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday r n Or never after look me in the face. r n Speak not, reply not, do not answer me! r n My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest r n That God had lent us but this only child; r n But now I see this one is one too much, r n And that we have a curse in having her. r n Out on her, hilding! r n r n Nurse. God in heaven bless her! r n You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. r n r n Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue, r n Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go! r n r n Nurse. I speak no treason. r n r n Cap. O, God-i-god-en! r n r n Nurse. May not one speak? r n r n Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool! r n Utter your gravity o &#39;er a gossip &#39;s bowl, r n For here we need it not. r n r n Lady. You are too hot. r n r n Cap. God &#39;s bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early, r n At home, abroad, alone, in company, r n Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been r n To have her match &#39;d; and having now provided r n A gentleman of princely parentage, r n Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train &#39;d, r n Stuff &#39;d, as they say, with honourable parts, r n Proportion &#39;d as one &#39;s thought would wish a man- r n And then to have a wretched puling fool, r n A whining mammet, in her fortune &#39;s tender, r n To answer &#39;I &#39;ll not wed, I cannot love; r n I am too young, I pray you pardon me &#39;! r n But, an you will not wed, I &#39;ll pardon you. r n Graze where you will, you shall not house with me. r n Look to &#39;t, think on &#39;t; I do not use to jest. r n Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: r n An you be mine, I &#39;ll give you to my friend; r n An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, r n For, by my soul, I &#39;ll ne &#39;er acknowledge thee, r n Nor what is mine shall never do thee good. r n Trust to &#39;t. Bethink you. I &#39;ll not be forsworn. Exit. r n r n Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds r n That sees into the bottom of my grief? r n O sweet my mother, cast me not away! r n Delay this marriage for a month, a week; r n Or if you do not, make the bridal bed r n In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. r n r n Lady. Talk not to me, for I &#39;ll not speak a word. r n Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. Exit. r n r n Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented? r n My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven. r n How shall that faith return again to earth r n Unless that husband send it me from heaven r n By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me. r n Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems r n Upon so soft a subject as myself! r n What say &#39;st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? r n Some comfort, nurse. r n r n Nurse. Faith, here it is. r n Romeo is banish &#39;d; and all the world to nothing r n That he dares ne &#39;er come back to challenge you; r n Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth. r n Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, r n I think it best you married with the County. r n O, he &#39;s a lovely gentleman! r n Romeo &#39;s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam, r n Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye r n As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, r n I think you are happy in this second match, r n For it excels your first; or if it did not, r n Your first is dead- or &#39;twere as good he were r n As living here and you no use of him. r n r n Jul. Speak &#39;st thou this from thy heart? r n r n Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both. r n r n Jul. Amen! r n r n Nurse. What? r n r n Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. r n Go in; and tell my lady I am gone, r n Having displeas &#39;d my father, to Laurence &#39; cell, r n To make confession and to be absolv &#39;d. r n r n Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. Exit. r n r n Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! r n Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, r n Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue r n Which she hath prais &#39;d him with above compare r n So many thousand times? Go, counsellor! r n Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. r n I &#39;ll to the friar to know his remedy. r n If all else fail, myself have power to die. Exit. r n r n r n r n r nACT IV. Scene I. r nFriar Laurence &#39;s cell. r n r nEnter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris. r n r n r n Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short. r n r n Par. My father Capulet will have it so, r n And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. r n r n Friar. You say you do not know the lady &#39;s mind. r n Uneven is the course; I like it not. r n r n Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt &#39;s death, r n And therefore have I little talk &#39;d of love; r n For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. r n Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous r n That she do give her sorrow so much sway, r n And in his wisdom hastes our marriage r n To stop the inundation of her tears, r n Which, too much minded by herself alone, r n May be put from her by society. r n Now do you know the reason of this haste. r n r n Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow &#39;d.- r n Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. r n r n Enter Juliet. r n r n r n Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife! r n r n Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. r n r n Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next. r n r n Jul. What must be shall be. r n r n Friar. That &#39;s a certain text. r n r n Par. Come you to make confession to this father? r n r n Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you. r n r n Par. Do not deny to him that you love me. r n r n Jul. I will confess to you that I love him. r n r n Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. r n r n Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price, r n Being spoke behind your back, than to your face. r n r n Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus &#39;d with tears. r n r n Jul. The tears have got small victory by that, r n For it was bad enough before their spite. r n r n Par. Thou wrong &#39;st it more than tears with that report. r n r n Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth; r n And what I spake, I spake it to my face. r n r n Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland &#39;red it. r n r n Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own. r n Are you at leisure, holy father, now, r n Or shall I come to you at evening mass r n r n Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. r n My lord, we must entreat the time alone. r n r n Par. God shield I should disturb devotion! r n Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye. r n Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. Exit. r n r n Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so, r n Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help! r n r n Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief; r n It strains me past the compass of my wits. r n I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, r n On Thursday next be married to this County. r n r n Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear &#39;st of this, r n Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. r n If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, r n Do thou but call my resolution wise r n And with this knife I &#39;ll help it presently. r n God join &#39;d my heart and Romeo &#39;s, thou our hands; r n And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo &#39;s seal &#39;d, r n Shall be the label to another deed, r n Or my true heart with treacherous revolt r n Turn to another, this shall slay them both. r n Therefore, out of thy long-experienc &#39;d time, r n Give me some present counsel; or, behold, r n &#39;Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife r n Shall play the empire, arbitrating that r n Which the commission of thy years and art r n Could to no issue of true honour bring. r n Be not so long to speak. I long to die r n If what thou speak &#39;st speak not of remedy. r n r n Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, r n Which craves as desperate an execution r n As that is desperate which we would prevent. r n If, rather than to marry County Paris r n Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, r n Then is it likely thou wilt undertake r n A thing like death to chide away this shame, r n That cop &#39;st with death himself to scape from it; r n And, if thou dar &#39;st, I &#39;ll give thee remedy. r n r n Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, r n From off the battlements of yonder tower, r n Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk r n Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears, r n Or shut me nightly in a charnel house, r n O &#39;ercover &#39;d quite with dead men &#39;s rattling bones, r n With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls; r n Or bid me go into a new-made grave r n And hide me with a dead man in his shroud- r n Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble- r n And I will do it without fear or doubt, r n To live an unstain &#39;d wife to my sweet love. r n r n Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent r n To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow. r n To-morrow night look that thou lie alone; r n Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. r n Take thou this vial, being then in bed, r n And this distilled liquor drink thou off; r n When presently through all thy veins shall run r n A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse r n Shall keep his native progress, but surcease; r n No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest; r n The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade r n To paly ashes, thy eyes &#39; windows fall r n Like death when he shuts up the day of life; r n Each part, depriv &#39;d of supple government, r n Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death; r n And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death r n Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours, r n And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. r n Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes r n To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. r n Then, as the manner of our country is, r n In thy best robes uncovered on the bier r n Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault r n Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. r n In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, r n Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift; r n And hither shall he come; and he and I r n Will watch thy waking, and that very night r n Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. r n And this shall free thee from this present shame, r n If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear r n Abate thy valour in the acting it. r n r n Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear! r n r n Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous r n In this resolve.

O mischief, thou art swift r n To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! r n I do remember an apothecary, r n And hereabouts &#39;a dwells, which late I noted r n In tatt &#39;red weeds, with overwhelming brows, r n Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks, r n Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; r n And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, r n An alligator stuff &#39;d, and other skins r n Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves r n A beggarly account of empty boxes, r n Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, r n Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses r n Were thinly scattered, to make up a show. r n Noting this penury, to myself I said, r n &#39;An if a man did need a poison now r n Whose sale is present death in Mantua, r n Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him. &#39; r n O, this same thought did but forerun my need, r n And this same needy man must sell it me. r n As I remember, this should be the house. r n Being holiday, the beggar &#39;s shop is shut.

Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua &#39;s law r n Is death to any he that utters them. r n r n Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness r n And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks, r n Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, r n Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back: r n The world is not thy friend, nor the world &#39;s law; r n The world affords no law to make thee rich; r n Then be not poor, but break it and take this. r n r n Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents. r n r n Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will. r n r n Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will r n And drink it off, and if you had the strength r n Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. r n r n Rom.

O me! this sight of death is as a bell r n That warns my old age to a sepulchre. r n r n Enter Montague [and others]. r n r n r n Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up r n To see thy son and heir more early down. r n r n Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night! r n Grief of my son &#39;s exile hath stopp &#39;d her breath. r n What further woe conspires against mine age? r n r n Prince. Look, and thou shalt see. r n r n Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this, r n To press before thy father to a grave? r n r n Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, r n Till we can clear these ambiguities r n And know their spring, their head, their true descent; r n And then will I be general of your woes r n And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, r n And let mischance be slave to patience. r n Bring forth the parties of suspicion. r n r n Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least, r n Yet most suspected, as the time and place r n Doth make against me, of this direful murther; r n And here I stand, both to impeach and purge r n Myself condemned and myself excus &#39;d. r n r n Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this. r n r n Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath r n Is not so long as is a tedious tale. r n Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; r n And she, there dead, that Romeo &#39;s faithful wife. r n I married them; and their stol &#39;n marriage day r n Was Tybalt &#39;s doomsday, whose untimely death r n Banish &#39;d the new-made bridegroom from this city; r n For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin &#39;d. r n You, to remove that siege of grief from her, r n Betroth &#39;d and would have married her perforce r n To County Paris. Then comes she to me r n And with wild looks bid me devise some mean r n To rid her from this second marriage, r n Or in my cell there would she kill herself. r n Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) r n A sleeping potion; which so took effect r n As I intended, for it wrought on her r n The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo r n That he should hither come as this dire night r n To help to take her from her borrowed grave, r n Being the time the potion &#39;s force should cease. r n But he which bore my letter, Friar John, r n Was stay &#39;d by accident, and yesternight r n Return &#39;d my letter back. Then all alone r n At the prefixed hour of her waking r n Came I to take her from her kindred &#39;s vault; r n Meaning to keep her closely at my cell r n Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. r n But when I came, some minute ere the time r n Of her awaking, here untimely lay r n The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. r n She wakes; and I entreated her come forth r n And bear this work of heaven with patience; r n But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, r n And she, too desperate, would not go with me, r n But, as it seems, did violence on herself. r n All this I know, and to the marriage r n Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this r n Miscarried by my fault, let my old life r n Be sacrific &#39;d, some hour before his time, r n Unto the rigour of severest law. r n r n Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man. r n Where &#39;s Romeo &#39;s man? What can he say in this? r n r n Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet &#39;s death; r n And then in post he came from Mantua r n To this same place, to this same monument. r n This letter he early bid me give his father, r n And threat &#39;ned me with death, going in the vault, r n If I departed not and left him there. r n r n Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it. r n Where is the County &#39;s page that rais &#39;d the watch? r n Sirrah, what made your master in this place? r n r n Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady &#39;s grave; r n And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. r n Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; r n And by-and-by my master drew on him; r n And then I ran away to call the watch. r n r n Prince. This letter doth make good the friar &#39;s words, r n Their course of love, the tidings of her death; r n And here he writes that he did buy a poison r n Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal r n Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. r n Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage, r n See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, r n That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! r n And I, for winking at you, discords too, r n Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish &#39;d. r n r n Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand. r n This is my daughter &#39;s jointure, for no more r n Can I demand. r n r n Mon. But I can give thee more; r n For I will raise her Statue in pure gold, r n That whiles Verona by that name is known, r n There shall no figure at such rate be set r n As that of true and faithful Juliet. r n r n Cap. As rich shall Romeo &#39;s by his lady &#39;s lie- r n Poor sacrifices of our enmity! r n r n Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings. r n The sun for sorrow will not show his head. r n Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; r n Some shall be pardon &#39;d, and some punished; r n For never was a story of more woe r n Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. r n Exeunt omnes. r n r nTHE END r n r n r n r n r n r n r n r n r nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare r n r n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMEO AND JULIET *** r n r n***** This file should be named 1112.txt or 1112.zip ***** r nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in: r n http://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/1/1112/ r n r n r n r nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions r nwill be renamed. r n r nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no r none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation r n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without r npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a r nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up r nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations r nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To r nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any r nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org r n r nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we r nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition r nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who r napproach us with offers to donate. r n r nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make r nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from r noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. r n r nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation r nmethods and addresses.

midwife, and she comes r n In shape no bigger than an agate stone r n On the forefinger of an alderman, r n Drawn with a team of little atomies r n Athwart men&#39;s noses as they lie asleep; r n Her wagon spokes made of long spinners&#39; legs, r n The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; r n Her traces, of the smallest spider&#39;s web; r n Her collars, of the moonshine&#39;s wat&#39;ry beams; r n Her whip, of cricket&#39;s bone; the lash, of film; r n Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, r n Not half so big as a round little worm r n Prick&#39;d from the lazy finger of a maid; r n Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, r n Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, r n Time out o&#39; mind the fairies&#39; coachmakers.&#34;, &#34;And in this state she &#39;gallops night by night r n Through lovers&#39; brains, and then they dream of love; r n O&#39;er courtiers&#39; knees, that dream on cursies straight; r n O&#39;er lawyers&#39; fingers, who straight dream on fees; r n O&#39;er ladies&#39; lips, who straight on kisses dream, r n Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, r n Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.&#34;, &#34;Sometime she gallops o&#39;er a courtier&#39;s nose, r n And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; r n And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig&#39;s tail r n Tickling a parson&#39;s nose as &#39;a lies asleep, r n Then dreams he of another benefice.&#34;, &#34;Sometimes she driveth o&#39;er a soldier&#39;s neck, r n And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, r n Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, r n Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon r n Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, r n And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two r n And sleeps again.&#34;, &#39;This is that very Mab r n That plats the manes of horses in the night r n And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs, r n Which once untangled much misfortune bodes r n This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, r n That presses them and learns them first to bear, r n Making them women of good carriage.&#39;, &#39;This is she- r n r n Rom.&#39;, &#39;Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!&#39;, &#34;Thou talk&#39;st of nothing.&#34;, &#39;Mer.&#39;, &#34;True, I talk of dreams; r n Which are the children of an idle brain, r n Begot of nothing but vain fantasy; r n Which is as thin of substance as the air, r n And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes r n Even now the frozen bosom of the North r n And, being anger&#39;d, puffs away from thence, r n Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.&#34;, &#39;Ben.&#39;, &#39;This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.&#39;, &#39;Supper is done, and we shall come too late.&#39;, &#39;Rom.&#39;, &#34;I fear, too early; for my mind misgives r n Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, r n Shall bitterly begin his fearful date r n With this night&#39;s revels and expire the term r n Of a despised life, clos&#39;d in my breast, r n By some vile forfeit of untimely death.&#34;, &#39;But he that hath the steerage of my course r n Direct my sail!&#39;, &#39;On, lusty gentlemen!&#39;, &#39;Ben.&#39;, &#39;Strike, drum.&#39;, &#39;They march about the stage.&#39;, &#39;[Exeunt.]&#39;, &#34;Scene V. r nCapulet&#39;s house.&#34;, &#39;Servingmen come forth with napkins.&#39;, &#39;1.&#39;, &#39;Serv.&#39;, &#34;Where&#39;s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?&#34;, &#39;He shift a trencher!&#39;, &#39;he scrape a trencher!&#39;, &#39;2.&#39;, &#39;Serv.&#39;, &#34;When good manners shall lie all in one or two men&#39;s r n hands, and they unwash&#39;d too, &#39;tis a foul thing.&#34;, &#39;1.&#39;, &#39;Serv.&#39;, &#39;Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert, r n look to the plate.&#39;, &#39;Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as r n thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and r nNell.&#39;, &#39;Anthony, and Potpan!&#39;, &#39;2.&#39;, &#39;Serv.&#39;, &#39;Ay, boy, ready.&#39;, &#39;1.&#39;, &#39;Serv.&#39;, &#34;You are look&#39;d for and call&#39;d for, ask&#39;d for and r n sought for, in the great chamber.&#34;, &#39;3.&#39;, &#39;Serv.&#39;, &#39;We cannot be here and there too.&#39;, &#39;Cheerly, boys!&#39;, &#39;Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.&#39;, &#39;Exeunt.&#39;, &#39;Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife, r n Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests r n and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.&#39;, &#39;Cap.&#39;, &#39;Welcome, gentlemen!&#39;, &#34;Ladies that have their toes r n Unplagu&#39;d with corns will have a bout with you.&#34;, &#39;Ah ha, my mistresses!&#39;, &#39;which of you all r n Will now deny to dance?&#39;, &#34;She that makes dainty, r n She I&#39;ll swear hath corns.&#34;, &#39;Am I come near ye now?&#39;, &#39;Welcome, gentlemen!&#39;, &#34;I have seen the day r n That I have worn a visor and could tell r n A whispering tale in a fair lady&#39;s ear, r n Such as would please.&#34;, &#34;&#39;Tis gone, &#39;tis gone, &#39;tis gone!&#34;, &#39;You are welcome, gentlemen!&#39;, &#39;Come, musicians, play.&#39;, &#39;A hall, a hall!&#39;, &#39;give room!&#39;, &#39;and foot it, girls.&#39;, &#39;Music plays, and they dance.&#39;, &#39;More light, you knaves!&#39;, &#39;and turn the tables up, r n And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.&#39;, &#34;Ah, sirrah, this unlook&#39;d-for sport comes well.&#34;, &#39;Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet, r n For you and I are past our dancing days.&#39;, &#34;How long is&#39;t now since last yourself and I r n Were in a mask?&#34;, &#39;2.&#39;, &#39;Cap.&#39;, &#34;By&#39;r Lady, thirty years.&#34;, &#39;Cap.&#39;, &#39;What, man?&#39;, &#34;&#39;Tis not so much, &#39;tis not so much!&#34;, &#34;&#39;Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, r n Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, r n Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask&#39;d.&#34;, &#39;2.&#39;, &#39;Cap.&#39;, &#34;&#39;Tis more, &#39;tis more!&#34;, &#39;His son is elder, sir;

r n For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin&#39;d.&#34;, &#34;You, to remove that siege of grief from her, r n Betroth&#39;d and would have married her perforce r n To County Paris.&#34;, &#39;Then comes she to me r n And with wild looks bid me devise some mean r n To rid her from this second marriage, r n Or in my cell there would she kill herself.&#39;, &#39;Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) r n A sleeping potion; which so took effect r n As I intended, for it wrought on her r n The form of death.&#39;, &#34;Meantime I writ to Romeo r n That he should hither come as this dire night r n To help to take her from her borrowed grave, r n Being the time the potion&#39;s force should cease.&#34;, &#34;But he which bore my letter, Friar John, r n Was stay&#39;d by accident, and yesternight r n Return&#39;d my letter back.&#34;, &#34;Then all alone r n At the prefixed hour of her waking r n Came I to take her from her kindred&#39;s vault; r n Meaning to keep her closely at my cell r n Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.&#34;, &#39;But when I came, some minute ere the time r n Of her awaking, here untimely lay r n The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.&#39;, &#39;She wakes; and I entreated her come forth r n And bear this work of heaven with patience; r n But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, r n And she, too desperate, would not go with me, r n But, as it seems, did violence on herself.&#39;, &#34;All this I know, and to the marriage r n Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this r n Miscarried by my fault, let my old life r n Be sacrific&#39;d, some hour before his time, r n Unto the rigour of severest law.&#34;, &#39;Prince.&#39;, &#39;We still have known thee for a holy man.&#39;, &#34;Where&#39;s Romeo&#39;s man?&#34;, &#39;What can he say in this?&#39;, &#39;Bal.&#39;, &#34;I brought my master news of Juliet&#39;s death; r n And then in post he came from Mantua r n To this same place, to this same monument.&#34;, &#34;This letter he early bid me give his father, r n And threat&#39;ned me with death, going in the vault, r n If I departed not and left him there.&#34;, &#39;Prince.&#39;, &#39;Give me the letter.&#39;, &#39;I will look on it.&#39;, &#34;Where is the County&#39;s page that rais&#39;d the watch?&#34;, &#39;Sirrah, what made your master in this place?&#39;, &#39;Boy.&#39;, &#34;He came with flowers to strew his lady&#39;s grave; r n And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.&#34;, &#39;Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; r n And by-and-by my master drew on him; r n And then I ran away to call the watch.&#39;, &#39;Prince.&#39;, &#34;This letter doth make good the friar&#39;s words, r n Their course of love, the tidings of her death;

Parking is quite rough on this part of Westwood. The restaurant felt a bit cramped during busier times (especially if you were seated in the middle tables) and there is limited outdoor seating. Service was a bit slow even for a Friday evening and not quite friendly.I got the mild spicy beef pot with rice. The hot pot comes with a choice of rice or vermicelli for dinner but keep in mind some hot pots already come with vermicelli. I was disappointed to find that the broth was very weak and the portion size for the price was just decent, although I do appreciate the variety of veggies in my pot.Overall, Ive definitely had better hot pot but appreciate having the option nearby. I probably wouldnt come back unless m with company that wants hot pot.&#39; scores.polarity_scores(review_2) #polarity categorized it as more neutral which is pretty accurate considering the yelp review gave them 3 stars . {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.069, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.821, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.11, &#39;compound&#39;: 0.7789} . review_3 = &#39;Came for a late lunch around 2 on a Friday and there was a table available right away. For lunch, the price is a dollar less and you also get a free tea, choices of wintermelon, black, or green. They dont do hot teas though. The teas definitely help cooled down the fire that was burning in my mouth after requesting spicier than I should. Everything is ordered via phone and they bring it out to you, but payment is not on the phone.I got the szeuchuan Mala and boy that was spicy! I definitely enjoyed but also suffered a day later if you know what I mean. I liked that it was your own so you can choose the flavor broth you want. There are a lots of flavor options, so is not just Chinese. Also ordered the fried pork appetizer and that was pretty great and crunchy.Definitely good place for your own hot pot. I was filled but I can see the need to order extra things and the prices racking up quick. Overall, Id come back to try the other broths.&#39; scores.polarity_scores(review_3) #i would say this review is much more positive than neutral espeically since it was a 5 star review . {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.042, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.791, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.168, &#39;compound&#39;: 0.9796} . review_4 = &quot;Not many hot pot joints on the west end anymore. Most of them unfortunately are overpriced, closed or just not that great to begin with. This all changed with the introduction of Northern Cafe Chinese Hot Pot. If you&#39;re looking to fill that void of hot bubbling meat soaking in broth, ready to be shoveled down your throat with some glass noodles, well this is your place.There&#39;s a variety of hot pot combos on the menu from lamb, to seafood along with various broths and spice levels to go with each. They also have a number of side dishes if you&#39;re looking to increase your chances at a food coma later in the evening. The popcorn chicken is legit!It&#39;s fast food style, but the service is still on point. The staff will top up your broth or light that flame under your pot whenever you ask. They are also great with coming up to check up on you, during your meal (much more than my ex ever did in my failed past relationship!). Will definitely come back here to fulfill that hot pot craving in the future!&quot; scores.polarity_scores(review_4) #this one is intersting because its polarity score was much more neutral when it actually was more positive than neutral and the review received 4 stars. . {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.063, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.848, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.089, &#39;compound&#39;: 0.2746} . review_5 = &quot;I ordered the spicy beef hotpot with medium spice and I enjoyed it! Their portions are quite large and there was a ton of beef in my dish. My partner got the seafood hot pot and they were generous with the seafood portion as well.

The experience this time was slightly less enjoyable. It was still tasty, but I feel like there was less stuff in the pot and not enough veggies. We did order extra lamb for $5.95 and they put it in the pot instead of on the side, which may have meant there was less space for veggies. The sweet potato fries were tasty but slightly overcooked, and possibly used old oil to fry because they were so dark. I think we will still return when we crave hot pot because it is the best in the area and the flavors are good. Golden beef pot is great. Beef is fatty (like 70% fat) and flavorful. The golden color probably comes from the oil.&quot; scores.polarity_scores(review_7) #i would say this review was definitely more positive than neutral yet the polarity score was much #more neutral - review was 4 stars . {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.828, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.172, &#39;compound&#39;: 0.9806} . review_8 = &quot;Tasty food but inattentive servers. I got the Golden Soup Beef hotpot dish, which I really enjoyed. We had to ask the waiters a few times to bring us water, though, which shouldn&#39;t have taken so long considering that we were eating dinner before the dinner rush started. 4 stars because I didn&#39;t come here expecting great service and I did enjoy my food.&quot; scores.polarity_scores(review_8) #very interesting how this one was rated a tad more positive even though this seemed much more neutral #in comparison to the previous review - review received 4 stars . {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.788, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.212, &#39;compound&#39;: 0.9504} . review_9 = &quot;Came here for dinner on a Friday night.

On August 6th, 2021, me and my three friends went to Northern Cafe Chinese Hotpot for dinner at around 8:10 pm. After I first used my first bank card, the cashier told me that the transaction did not go through, even though I have already got the notification from the bank that the correct amount had already been charged. He insisted and threatened me to try again with another card, otherwise, our food will not be served, and we need to leave the restaurant. After checking with my bank, they promised me if this transaction actually went through, they could help me get the money back through their arbitration process, that&#39;s when I reluctantly used my second card to pay AGAIN for the full amount.Now, when my bank tries to resolve this problem with them, they are using all kinds of excuses to make it extremely hard for me to get the money back after I presented all the proofs.&quot; scores.polarity_scores(review_10) #this yelp review was actually only 1 star and pretty negative, yet the polarity review categorized it as pretty neutral . {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.091, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.848, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.061, &#39;compound&#39;: -0.3} . review_11 = &quot;There are miniscule complaints, but overall the meal was too good to let little things get in the way.

I can tell you this place is 100% authentic and they do NOT compromise their flavors for the area they&#39;re in (aka no flavor dilution). When they say something is spicy, it is REALLY spicy. I ordered the beef pot, mild, and was sweating the whole time. Although it was slightly painful, I still enjoyed every bit of it. The price is slightly higher than what I&#39;m used to in the SGV, but they give you a lot of different ingredients to add to the value, such as mushrooms, different seafood balls, veggies, clear glass noodles, etc. They also give a lot of meat, so that&#39;s always welcomed. I would suggest coming here to dine in person as take out definitely takes away from the entire experience.They have both indoor and outdoor seating.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
